### Cryptology
There are 2 branches
1. Cryptography: people trying to encrypt shits
  - Symetric algorithm
  - Asymetric algorithm
  - Protocols
2. Cryptanlysis: People trying to break shits

### What is the relationship between security and crytography
- Security is the super set of cryptography

# Setup for symetric cryptography
(simple) problem: communication over insecure channel

Alice              **communicate**                  bob
                  (Insecure channel)

What is the channel example in this picture
- Internet
- Air waves GSM, wifi
- ... etc
